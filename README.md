# IEEE Quantum Week Challenge: Optimizing QAOA Transpilation

Welcome to the **IEEE Quantum Week Challenge** on optimizing **QAOA transpilation**! In this 2-hour challenge, you'll explore how to optimize quantum circuits using the [Qiskit SDK](https://www.ibm.com/quantum) and the [Qiskit Transpiler service](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/qiskit-transpiler-service). You'll focus on transpilation strategies and learn how to map circuits efficiently to a given quantum architecture while minimizing circuit depth and gate count.

This repository hosts the challenge notebook, designed in the style of the **IBM Quantum Challenge**.

## Objective

Your goal is to develop a custom transpiler workflow that can efficiently map QAOA circuits to quantum hardware, optimizing for both performance and accuracy. This challenge is divided into **Beginner** and **Advanced** tracks, each providing unique coding exercises and performance assessments.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HuangJunye/ieee-qiskit-transpilation-challenge.git
   ``` 

2. **Install dependencies**
Make sure you have Python installed, then run the following to install required packages in your working environment:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ``` 
3. **Run the notebook**
Launch a Jupyter notebook or lab instance and open the notebook file `challenge.ipynb` and start coding!
